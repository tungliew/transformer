1. AnnotatedTransformer.ipynb is an annotated transformer file created by harvardnlp group.
   https://github.com/harvardnlp/annotated-transformer/blob/master/AnnotatedTransformer.ipynb

2. Aim of this annotated_transformer.ipynp is to observe how the data is transformered in each transformer blaock based on inference_test(), therefore we can have a better understanding of attention.

3. Note: I just finished Part I: Model Architecture, 
   details like function of scaling will be added later.

4. To do list:
   Part II: Model Traning,
   Part III: A Real World Example
